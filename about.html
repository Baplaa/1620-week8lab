        <p>My name is Tristan Lingat and I immigrated to Vancouver, BC in 2011 from Manila, Philippines. 
            I can no longer fluently speak Tagalog but I can still read and write at an OK level. I can also understand a hint of Spanish, 
            thanks to high school. Speaking of which, I recently graduated high school this year and I am 18 years old. 
            A majority of my time spent alive so far have been well-spent on my hobbies.</p>
